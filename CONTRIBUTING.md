## We'll warn you a few times for these:

- Please be polite with others.
- Please don't bother us with (lack of) inclusiveness. We welcome everybody here, but don't expect us to be able to accommodate everyone. Mistakes may happen. Discuss these issues in private.

## We'll have to part ways immediately for these:

- We cherish diversity, but please don't force your views on others.
- Ideologies, politics, religions: please keep them for yourself. This is not the place to express them.
- No hate speech and/or harrassment of any kind
